Class Scope<br><br>Another important aspect of Python classes is scope. The scope of a variable is the context in which it's visible to the program.<br><br>It may surprise you to learn that not all variables are accessible to all parts of a Python program at all times. When dealing with classes, you can have variables that are available everywhere (global variables), variables that are only available to members of a certain class (member variables), and variables that are only available to particular instances of a class (instance variables).<br><br>The same goes for functions: some are available everywhere, some are only available to members of a certain class, and still others are only available to particular instance objects.
