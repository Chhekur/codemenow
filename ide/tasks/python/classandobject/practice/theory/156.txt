More on __init__() and self<br><br>Now that you're starting to understand how classes and objects work, it's worth delving a bit more into __init__() and self. They can be confusing!<br><br>As mentioned, you can think of __init__() as the method that ''boots up'' a class' instance object: the init bit is short for ''initialize.''<br><br>The first argument __init__() gets is used to refer to the instance object, and by convention, that argument is called self. If you add additional arguments—for instance, a name and age for your animal—setting each of those equal to self.name and self.age in the body of __init__() will make it so that when you create an instance object of your Animal class, you need to give each instance a name and an age, and those will be associated with the particular instance you create.
