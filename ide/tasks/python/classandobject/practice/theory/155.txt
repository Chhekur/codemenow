Instantiating Your First Object<br><br>Perfect! Now we're ready to start creating objects.<br><br>We can access attributes of our objects using dot notation. Here's how it works:<br><br>class Square(object):<br>  def __init__(self):<br>    self.sides = 4<br><br>my_shape = Square()<br>print my_shape.sides<br>First we create a class named Square with an attribute sides.<br>Outside the class definition, we create a new instance of Square named my_shape and access that attribute using my_shape.sides.
