Warning: Here Be Dragons<br><br>Inheritance is a tricky concept, so let's go through it step by step.<br><br>Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another, and it's used to express an is-a relationship. For example, a Panda is a bear, so a Panda class could inherit from a Bear class. However, a Toyota is not a Tractor, so it shouldn't inherit from the Tractor class (even if they have a lot of attributes and methods in common). Instead, both Toyota and Tractor could ultimately inherit from the same Vehicle class.
