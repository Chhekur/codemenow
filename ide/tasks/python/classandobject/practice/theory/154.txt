Let's Not Get Too Selfish<br><br>Excellent! Let's make one more tweak to our class definition, then go ahead and instantiate (create) our first object.<br><br>So far, __init__() only takes one parameter: self. This is a Python convention; there's nothing magic about the word self. However, it's overwhelmingly common to use self as the first parameter in __init__(), so you should do this so that other people will understand your code.<br><br>The part that is magic is the fact that self is the first parameter passed to __init__(). Python will use the first parameter that __init__() receives to refer to the object being created; this is why it's often called self, since this parameter gives the object being created its identity.
