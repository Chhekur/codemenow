They're Multiplying!<br><br>A class can have any number of member variables. These are variables that are available to all members of a class.<br><br>hippo = Animal(''Jake'', 12)<br>cat = Animal(''Boots'', 3)<br>print hippo.is_alive<br>hippo.is_alive = False<br>print hippo.is_alive<br>print cat.is_alive<br>In the example above, we create two instances of an Animal.<br>Then we print out True, the default value stored in hippo's is_alive member variable.<br>Next, we set that to False and print it out to make sure.<br>Finally, we print out True, the value stored in cat's is_alive member variable. We only changed the variable in hippo, not in cat.<br>Let's add another member variable to Animal.
