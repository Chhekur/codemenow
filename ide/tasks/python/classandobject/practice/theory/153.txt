Classier Classes<br><br>We'd like our classes to do more than... well, nothing, so we'll have to replace our pass with something else.<br><br>You may have noticed in our example back in the first exercise that we started our class definition off with an odd-looking function: __init__(). This function is required for classes, and it's used to initialize the objects it creates. __init__() always takes at least one argument, self, that refers to the object being created. You can think of __init__() as the function that ''boots up'' each object the class creates.
