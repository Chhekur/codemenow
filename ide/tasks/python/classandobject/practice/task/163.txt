<li>Create a new class, 'PartTimeEmployee', that inherits from 'Employee'.</li><li>Give your derived class a 'calculate_wage' function that overrides Employee's. It should take 'self' and 'hours' as arguments.</li><li>Because<br> ' PartTimeEmployee'.'calculate_wage' overrides Employee.'calculate_wage', it still needs to set 'self.hours = hours'.</li><li>It should return the part-time employee's number of hours worked multiplied by 12.00 (that is, they get $12.00 per hour instead of $20.00).</li>
