A Hello, world! program is often used to introduce beginning programmers to a programming language. In general, it is simple enough to be understood easily, especially with the guidance of a teacher or a written guide. In addition, Hello world! can be a useful sanity test to make sure that a language's compiler, development environment, and run-time environment are correctly installed. Configuring a complete programming toolchain from scratch to the point where even trivial programs can be compiled and run can involve substantial amounts of work. For this reason, a simple program is used first when testing a new tool chain.
